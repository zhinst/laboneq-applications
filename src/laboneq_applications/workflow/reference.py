class Reference:
    """A reference class.

    A `Reference` is a placeholder for objects used while a workflow
    graph is being constructed.

    If tasks are the nodes in the workflow graph, then references define the edges.

    For example, in a workflow definition like:

    ```python
    @workflow
    def add_and_multiply(a, b):
        c = add_task(a, 2)
        d = multiply_task(c, 3)
    ```

    the values `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are all references. By tracking where references
    are used, the graph builder can determine how inputs and outputs are passed between
    tasks in the graph.

    References also track some Python operations performed on them, so one can also use
    references like `a["value"]`. This creates a reference for "the item named 'value'
    from reference 'a'".

    When a workflow graph is run, the references are used to determine the input values
    to the next task from the outputs returned by the earlier tasks.

    The following operations are supported

    * __getitem__()
    * __getattr__()
    * __eq__()

    Notes on specific Python operations
    ---

    *Equality comparison*

    For equality comparison, especially with booleans, use `==` instead of `is`.
        Equality with `is` will always return `False`.

    Arguments:
        ref: An object this reference points to.
        default: Default value of `ref`.
