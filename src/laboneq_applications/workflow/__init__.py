"""A package for creating workflows.

This package provides tools and building blocks to define workflows.

# Summary

Workflow is a collection of tasks and other constructs.
To determine and control the execution of an workflow, the tasks
and other constructs do not behave normally within a workflow decorated Python function
and a specific domain specific language (DSL) must be used.

To achieve this behavior, workflow first runs through the code
to build a dependency graph of tasks and constructs used in it. The actual code
within the tasks is not yet executed.
For this reason, regular Python expressions cannot be used within the workflow
and it is recommended to use tasks for any complex logic.
