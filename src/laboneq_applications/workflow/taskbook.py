"""This module defines objects related to taskbook.

A taskbook is a collection of tasks and their records.

Whenever a task is executed within a taskbook, its'
arguments, result and other relevant information is
saved into the taskbook records.

## Example

### Building and running the taskbook

```python
from laboneq.workflow import task, taskbook

def addition(x, y):
    return x + y

@task
def my_task(x):
   return x + 1

@taskbook
def my_taskbook(x):
    x = addition(1, x)
    my_task(x)
    return "success"

result = my_taskbook(x=5)
```

### Inspecting the results

The results of all tasks are recorded and may be inspected later
using the result object returned by the taskbook.

The taskbook output and the information of each task execution
can be accessed from the result object:

```python
>>> result.output
"success"
>>> result.tasks[0].output
7
>>> result.tasks[0].args
(6,)
```

As `addition()` was not marked as a task, it has no records in the taskbook.

### Running functions as tasks

If a function is a normal Python function and you'd wish to run it as a task within the
taskbook without adding the `task()` decorator, it can be done by wrapping the
function with it.

This also works if you wish to save only specific calls to the function.

```python
@taskbook
def my_taskbook(x):
    x = task(addition)(1, x)  # Record will be saved
    y = addition(2, x)  # No record saved
```

Now the normal Python function `addition()` wrapped in `task()` will have records
within the taskbook.
