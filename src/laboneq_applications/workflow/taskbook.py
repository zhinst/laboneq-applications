"""This module defines objects related to taskbook.

A taskbook is a collection of tasks and their records.

Whenever a task is executed within a taskbook, its'
arguments, result and other relevant information is
saved into the taskbook records.

## Example

### Building and running the taskbook

```python
from laboneq.workflow import task, taskbook

@task
def my_task(x):
   return x + 1

@taskbook
def my_taskbook(x):
    my_task(x)
    return "success"

result = my_taskbook(x=5)
```

### Inspecting the results

The results of all tasks are recorded and may be inspected later
using the result object returned by the taskbook.

The taskbook return value and the information of each task execution
can be accessed from the result object:

```python
>>> result.result
"success"
>>> result.tasks[0].result
6
>>> result.tasks[0].args
(5,)
```
