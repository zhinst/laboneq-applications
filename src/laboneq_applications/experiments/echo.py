"""This module defines the Hahn echo experiment.

In the Hahn echo experiment, we perform a Ramsey experiment and place one extra
refocusing pulse, typically y180, between the two x90 pulses. Due to this additional
pulse, the quasi-static contributions to dephasing can be “refocused” and by that the
experiment is less sensitive to quasi-static noise.

The pulses are generally chosen to be resonant with the qubit transition for a
Hahn echo, since any frequency detuning would be nominally refocused anyway.

The Hahn echo experiment has the following pulse sequence:

    qb --- [ prep transition ] --- [ x90_transition ] --- [ delay/2 ] ---
    [ refocusing pulse ] --- [ delay/2 ] --- [ x90_transition ] --- [ measure ]

If multiple qubits are passed to the experiment workflow, the above pulses are applied
in parallel on all the qubits.
