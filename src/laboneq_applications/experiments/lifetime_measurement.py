"""This module defines the lifetime_measurement experiment.

In this experiment, the qubit is first excited to either its first
or a higher excited state
and then allowed to relax back to the ground state over a variable delay period,
enabling us to measure the qubit's longitudinal
relaxation time, lifetime_measurement, for the respective state.

The lifetime_measurement experiment has the following pulse sequence:

    qb --- [ prep transition ] --- [ x180_transition ] --- [delay] --- [ measure ]

If multiple qubits are passed to the `run` workflow, the above pulses are applied
in parallel on all the qubits.
