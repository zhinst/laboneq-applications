# Tutorials

## Introduction

This section of the documentation provides practical guides and examples on how to use the components of the LabOneQ Applications library.

## Getting Started - Defining your Experimental Setup

If you are just getting started using the how-to guides showcasing Workflows, Quantum Operations, and Tasks, 
our tutorial on defining your [experimental Setup](sources/getting_started.ipynb) can help get you up-and-running.

## Experiment Workflows

[This tutorial](sources/experiment_workflows.ipynb) shows how to run predefined experiment workflows.

## Qubits and Quantum Operations

Each set of quantum operations defines operations for a particular type of qubit.
At the moment the library only provides operations for tunable transmon qubits.
[In this tutorial](sources/quantum_operations.ipynb) we'll introduce you to these operations and 
show you how they make use of the qubit parameters to implement qubit gates.

## Writing New Experiment Workflows

[This tutorial](sources/writing_experiments.ipynb) teaches you how to write new experiment workflows
like the ones made provided by the Applications Library.

## Logbooks

[This tutorial](sources/logbooks.ipynb) is an introduction for logbooks.
The logbook store defines where a workflow will store the inputs and
results of its tasks. For example, in a folder on disk. The store may also be
used to retrieve data and to store your own data.
