    "* we have specified the type of the `options` input parameters as `TuneupExperimentOptions | None`. You do not need to do this for quick prototyping, but you have to do this when using the `create_experiment_multi_qubit_options` task inside a `Workflow`. As explained in the [tutorial on options](https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/core/functionality_and_concepts/07_workflow/02_options.html), the `Workflow` mechanism automatically resolves the tree of task options for its constituent `Tasks`, such that they are all available to be configured at the `Workflow` level before running your experiment `Workflow`. However, this automatic resolution only happens if the type of the `options` input parameter of each `Task` is specified as an instance of `TaskOptions`, in our case `CreateExperimentOptions`. If this type specification is omitted, the `Workflow` does not detect that this `Task` accepts options and they will not be configurable when you want to run your experiment.\n",

In case the transition on which to run the experiment is not \"ge\", we must first prepare the lowermost state in the transition (for example, \"e\" if `transition=\"ef\"`). The `prepare_state` in the set of operations for tunable transmons ([TunableTransmonOperations](https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/applications_library/reference/qpu_types/tunable_transmon.html#laboneq_applications.qpu_types.tunable_transmon.TunableTransmonOperations)) accepts `\"g\"`, `\"e\"` and `\"f\"` as states to prepare.\n",
