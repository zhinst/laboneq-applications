    "\n",
    "In this section we go through the process of combining our predefined tasks into a\n",
    "single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow in itself should be as simple as possible and it should not contain any complex\n",
    "operations. Most operations should happen within the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow can be defined by decorating a Python function with `@workflow` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is marked as a `workflow`, it has some limitations to a normal Python\n",
    "execution flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only functions marked as tasks should be called within a workflow definition\n",
    "* Using Python statements (`if`, `else`, `for`, etc.) should not be used in the Workflow, however they can be used freely in tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for above limitations is to ensure that a graph of dependencies between tasks\n",
    "can be created and the `Workflow` can then fully control the execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow references\n",
    "\n",
    "While the workflow is being constructed, the actual variables (workflow inputs, task outputs) are replaced\n",
    "with a `Reference` object that then connects the producing and receiving ends of an variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default `Reference` supports only a subset of default Python operations, for example, `__getitem__` and\n",
    "`__getattr__`. The supported operations can be seen from `Reference` documentation."
