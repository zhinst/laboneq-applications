# tasks

This is the `laboneq_applications.tasks` reference documentation.

This sub-package describes predefined tasks that are available in the workflow system. Tasks are the building blocks of workflows. They are the individual steps that are executed in a workflow. Each task has a specific purpose and can be used to perform a specific action. They can be ran standalone, but usually are used in combination with other tasks in a workflow, where they are evaluated once the workflow is executed.
