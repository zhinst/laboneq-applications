# How-to Guides - Superconducting Qubits

The following guides are intended to help you become familiar with how different experiments can be written in LabOne Q. Depending on your specific use case and architecture, you will likely wish to modify these experiments and adapt them to your own use case. Please get in touch at <info@zhinst.com> and we will be happy discuss your application.


## Pulse-level Experiments

The pulse-level experiment how-to guides are intended to help you get familiar with writing and using your own pulse sequences in LabOne Q, from tune-up to advanced experiments including:

### Spectroscopy

* [Resonator Spectroscopy](02_pulse_sequences/01_tuneup/01_cw_resonator_spec_shfsg_shfqa_shfqc.ipynb)
* [Resonator Spectroscopy vs Power](02_pulse_sequences/01_tuneup//03_resonator_spec_vs_power_shfsg_shfqa_shfqc.ipynb)

### Control Pulse Tune-up

* [Rabi](02_pulse_sequences/01_tuneup/06_amplitude_rabi.ipynb)
* [Ramsey](02_pulse_sequences/01_tuneup/07_ramsey.ipynb)

### Additional Experiments

* [Active Reset](02_pulse_sequences/02_advanced_qubit_experiments/00_active_qubit_reset_shfsg_shfqa_shfqc.ipynb)
* [Randomized Benchmarking](02_pulse_sequences/02_advanced_qubit_experiments/01_randomized_benchmarking.ipynb)

Look at the navigation to see the full list of available experiments.
