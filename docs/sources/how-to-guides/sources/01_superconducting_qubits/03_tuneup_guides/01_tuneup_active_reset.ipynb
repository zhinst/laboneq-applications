    "### Background\n",
    "In order to execute any set of gates on a quantum bit (qubit), the latter needs to be prepared in a known state. This state is usually the qubit’s ground state, denoted either by 'g' or '0'. This preparation is most simply done by waiting: the qubit naturally relaxes into its thermal ground state at an exponential rate given by its lifetime $T_1$. Note that the thermal ground state differs to the true ground state of the qubit by the amount of thermal population produced by unwanted thermal excitation of the qubit. A good rule of thumb for letting the qubit relax into its thermal ground state is to wait for a time of around $3T_1$ after every measurement. However, as qubit lifetimes increase with further improvements in the qubit-fabrication processes, this reset waiting time becomes prohibitively long, leading to a idling overhead in quantum computation. For example, with a lifetime of $T_1 = 100 \\mu$s, a simple Rabi experiment with 10 points and 4096 averages per point, already results in a total measurement time of around 12 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Active reset is a technique that uses the discrimination and feedback logic in our instruments in order to prepare a qubit in its true ground state with minimal waiting time given by the processing latency of the instruments. A diagram of the three-step active reset process is shown in Figure 1 below. The measured signal carrying information about the qubit response is received by the Quantum Analyzer (QA), where, in the first step, it is integrated with the complex weights . Then, in a second step, the integration result is sent to the discrimination unit of the instrument, which classifies the complex value of the integrated signal into one of the qudit states (0, 1, 2 …) depending on the discrimination thresholds and other settings with which the discrimination unit was configured. Finally, in the last step, the discrimination results is fed back to the Signal Generator (SG) instrument, which has been configured to play back the correct pulse to reset the qubit into the ground state. \n",
