    "### Background\n",
    "In this guide, you'll conduct a measurement to observe the time-resolved photon number in a resonator during qubit readout, when the qubit is in it's ground state. This will be achieved using the `resonator_photons_time_resolved` experiment available in the LabOne Q Applications Library. To know the photon number during the readout can be essential, especially when trying to optimize the readout. The physical background behind this experiment is tied to the shift in the qubit frequency in response to the photon number $n$ accumulated in the resonator by the readout pulse, as expressed by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta\\omega_\\text{ge}=-2\\chi n.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\chi$ represents the $\\chi$-shift, a parameter that determines the shift in the resonator frequency based on the qubit state. Due to the resonator's finite linewidth $\\kappa$, it undergoes a process of photon accumulation and depletion, known as ring up and ring down. The evolution of the resonator photons over time can be analyzed by examining the time-dependent shift in the qubit's frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta\\omega_\\text{ge}(t)=-2\\chi n(t).$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you will perform a time-resolved qubit spectroscopy by applying a short spectroscopy pulse. This pulse needs to be significantly shorter than both the pulse under investigation (inspect pulse) and the resonator's dynamic timescale, ensuring proper resolution of the time-dependent photon number. Additionally, the spectroscopy pulse frequency is swept to resolve changes in the qubit frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectroscopy pulse is applied at various time positions $\\tau$ across the inspect pulse to examine its impact on the resonator photons over time, as indicated by its effect on the qubit's frequency. A second readout pulse is necessary to measure the spectroscopy signal. The pulse sequence for this procedure is illustrated below.\n",

    "$$n(t)=-\\frac{\\Delta\\omega_\\text{ge}(t)}{2\\chi}.$$ \n",
