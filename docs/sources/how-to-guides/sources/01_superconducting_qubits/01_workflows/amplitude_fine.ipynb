Please see these guides (add links) if you need to create your setup and qubits for the first time. However, you can also run this notebook \"as is\" using an emulated session. If you are just getting started with the LabOne Q Applications Library, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at info@zhinst.com."

    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll optimize the pulse amplitude of the pi-pulse for a given qubit transition using the `amplitude_fine` experiment included in the LabOne Q Applications Library. It is recommended to have the pulse amplitude already roughly calibrated, e.g. with the `amplitude_rabi` experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude of a pulse can be precisely calibrated using error amplifying gate sequences. These gate sequences apply the same quantum operation (qop) a variable number of times. Therefore, if each qop has a small error $\\theta$ in the rotation angle then a sequence of multiple qop's will have a rotation error of $\\text{reps}\\cdot \\theta$, where $\\text{reps}$ is the number of repetitions. By implementing sequences with increasing number of repetitions we can obtain a correction value for the imperfect pulse amplitude (see also https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-experiments/tutorials/calibrations). A larger number of repetitions leads to a higher precision in the pulse calibration, finally limited by the coherence time of the qubit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/amplitude_fine.svg \"Demonstration of pulses and the corresponding rotation around the Bloch sphere during an amplitude fine experiment.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `amplitude_fine` experiment, we add an x90 gate before the gates that are repeated, in order to move the ideal population to the equator of the Bloch sphere where the sensitivity to over/under rotations is the highest. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/amplitude_fine_underrotation.svg \"Pulses with too small ammplitudes cause under-rotation.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show the results of an amplitude-fine experiment for calibration an x180 operation. The ping-pong pattern in the figure on the left indicates an under-rotation which makes the initial state rotate less than $\\pi$. The rotated phase per gate $\\phi_{\\text{x180}}$ is given by the frequency of the fitted oscillation. The comparison to the ideal angle defines the correction factor $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "$c=\\frac{\\phi_{\\text{x180}}}{\\pi}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we scale our amplitude by $c^{-1}$ to obtain the optimized amplitude. \n",
