    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll perform a Hahn echo experiment to measure the transversal relaxation of a qubit using the `echo` experiment included in the LabOne Q Applications Library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous how-to-guide, we already used Ramsey interferometry (link to ramsey how-to) to measure the transversal relaxation ( $T_2^*$ ). However, the Ramsey experiment is sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations. The Hahn echo protocol is less sensitive to quasi-static noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ramsey protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a short summary of the Ramsey protocol: \n",
    "\n",
    "A $X_{\\pi/2}$ (X90) pulse positions the Bloch vector on the equator (Fig. 1a). Typically, the carrier frequency of this pulse is slightly detuned from the qubit frequency. As a result, the Bloch vector will rotate around the z-axis. After waiting for a time $\\tau$, a second $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the z-axis. Repeated measurements are made to take an ensemble averaged estimate of the qubit polarization, as a function of $\\tau$. The resulting oscillations feature an approximately exponential decay function with decaytime $T_2^*$. (from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06560)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the “ $^*$ ” indicates that the Ramsey experiment is sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening. That is, it is highly sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations that are constant within one experimental trial, but vary from trial to trial, e.g., due to $1/f$-type noise. These fluctuations cause a dephasing of the qubit state (Fig. 1b) during the time $\\tau$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hahn echo protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's have a look at the Hahn echo protocol, which is less sensitive to quasi-static noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform the same protocol as for the Ramsey interferometry, but place one extra $Y_\\pi$ (Y180) pulse in-between the two $X_{\\pi/2}$ pulses (X90). The accumulated dephasing during the first period can be undone (refocused) in the second period by rotating the qubit state by 180 $^\\circ$ in-between through an $Y_{\\pi}$ pulse. The final $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the z-axis. In summary the overall quasi-static contributions to dephasing are reduced, leaving an estimate $T_{2e}$ that is less sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pulses are generally chosen to be resonant with the qubit transition for a Hahn echo, since any frequency detuning would be nominally refocused anyway.\n",
