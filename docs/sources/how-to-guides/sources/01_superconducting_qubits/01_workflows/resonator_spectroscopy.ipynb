The LabOne Q Applications Library provides different experiment workflows to achieve this task. You can either just sweep the frequency of a measure-pulse using the `resonator_spectroscopy` experiment workflow, or perform a 2D sweep to optimize at the same time the amplitude of the measure-pulse (the `resonator_spectroscopy_amplitude` experiment workflow). The measure-pulse modulated at different frequencies will be sent on a readout line traversing multiple resonators each coupled with one qubit.\n",
