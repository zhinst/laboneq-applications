    "### Background\n",
    "In this guide, you will learn how to characterize a ZZ coupling between a pair of qubits mediated by a tunable coupler and use this information to set a bias to the coupler that maximize the gate contrast. This will be performed using the `zz_coupling_strength` experiment available in the LabOne Q Applications Library. Residual coupling between qubits during idle times is a significant source of leakage errors. The challenge is to develop a coupling scheme that allows low coupling in idle time and strong coupling when the gate is applied, to have both small leakage error and high gate fidelity. Let's take for example a ZZ tunable interaction described by the Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{\\text{eff}}/\\hbar = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,2}\\left(\\omega_i + \\frac{\\alpha_\\text{ZZ}}{2}\\right)\\sigma_\\text{z}^{(i)} + \\frac{\\alpha_\\text{ZZ}}{4} \\sigma_\\text{z}^{(1)}\\sigma_\\text{z}^{(2)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, $\\omega_{1,2}$ are the qubit frequencies, $\\sigma_{\\text{ZZ}}$ is the tunable cross-Kerr ZZ-interaction rate, and $\\sigma_\\text{Z}^{(1),(2)}$ are the Pauli operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the scheme presented in the image below, we use the frequency of the coupler element as a control parameter to tune $\\alpha_\\text{ZZ}$. To characterize the dependency of this parameter on the coupler frequency, we can study the frequency of $Q_1$ in a modified echo experiment for both cases of $Q_2$ being in the ground and the excited state. The resulting frequency difference will correspond to the parameter $\\alpha_\\text{ZZ}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Schematic illustration of the transversal interaction between two qubits and their coupler](../../../images/ZZcoupling_sketch.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the frequency of the coupler, we apply a static magnetic flux $\\phi$ and observe the frequency shift of $Q_1$, as illustrated above. This means that in our experiment we will sweep two parameters: the DC bias applied to the coupler, and the delay between two `x90` to perform the modified Echo. The result will be a map between the bias applied and the frequency difference depending on the state of $Q_2$, which can be directly interpreted as the coupling between our two qubits. From here, one can set the DC bias where the coupling is minimal to guarantee smallest coupling in idle time, while reaching the maximum coupling using fast flux pulses during gates.\n",
