    "In this how-to guide, you'll perform a measurement to determine the qubit transition frequency. The LabOne Q Applications Library provides different experiment workflows to achieve this task. You can either just sweep the frequency of a qubit drive pulse using the `qubit_spectroscopy` experiment workflow, or perform a 2D sweep to optimize at the same time the amplitude of the qubit drive pulse (the `qubit_spectroscopy_amplitude` experiment workflow).\n",

    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/qubit_ge.svg \"Sketch of ground and first excited states of a qubit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As the swept qubit drive frequency comes close to the qubit transition frequency, the qubit will be driven out of its ground state. Due to dispersive coupling (see dispersive readout how-to for more detail), the signal from the readout resonator will then experience a shift in magnitude and phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting the readout signal, we can obtain a lorentzian lineshape as a function of the qubit drive frequency. This lorentzian will be centered around the qubit transition frequency, and from its linewidth we can approximate the qubit dephasing time. Below is an example dataplot of a qubit spectroscopy measurement:\n",
