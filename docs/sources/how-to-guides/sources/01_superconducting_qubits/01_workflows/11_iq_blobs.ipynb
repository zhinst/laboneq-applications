    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll investigate the complex response of qubit readout for different qubit states and display the results in the IQ-plane. The experiment itself is very simple: we prepare the qubit in the one of its basis states - g, e, or f - and perform single-shot measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements on superconducting qubits such as Transmons are often based on dispersive readout. Here, the qubit (Qubit) itself is not directly probed, instead a resonator (Res), which is coupled capacitively to the qubit, is probed with a measure pulse close to its resonance frequency (see figure below). The amplitude and phase of the returning measure pulse (here transmitted) contain information about the qubit state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the effect that the readout resonator is sensitive to the qubit state as depicted by the transmitted amplitude and phase response of the readout resonator below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In the dispersive limit, i.e., when the qubit frequency is far detuned from the resonance frequency of the resonator, there is no direct exchange of energy between the two systems. Hence, we minimize back action on the qubit (quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement).\n",

    "\n",
    "In the `iq_blobs` experiment we prepare the qubit in the one of its basis states - e.g. g or e - and perform single-shot measurements. \n",
    "For each single-shot measurement we demodulate and integrate the resonator response to obtain the in-phase ( $I$ ) and quadrature ( $Q$ ) component (link to qubit_readout explanation). Amplitude $A$ and phase $\\theta$ of a single-shot measurement are directly related to in-phase and quadrature components via \n",

    "By repeating the single-shot measurements many times, we obtain the state distribution for each state in the complex plane. Below a schematic complex plane representation of states $g$ and $e$, composed of the in-phase ( $I$ ) and quadrature ( $Q$ ) components. \n",
