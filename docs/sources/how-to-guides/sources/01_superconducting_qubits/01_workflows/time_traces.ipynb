This can be done here for every qubit in the sample for every possible combination of the states $\\ket{g}$, $\\ket{e}$ and $\\ket{f}$. In a future version of the guide, the raw time traces will be used to determine the optimal integration kernel for qubit readout, achieving maximal distinguishability between different qubit states. \n",

At each time $t$, the optimal integration weights can be calculated as $w_{i, j}(t) = \\overline{r_i(t) - r_j(t)}$, where $r_i$ denotes the time trace with the qubit in state $i$ and the horizontal bar represents the complex conjugate. Note that in general only $n-1$ different integration weights need to be explicitly measured since the remaining ones can be obtained from the pairwise difference of the measured weights."
