    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll perform a measurement to find the optimal response frequency of a resonator to maximize signal-to-noise for a qubit measurement. The LabOne Q Applications Library provides different experiment workflows to achieve this task. You can either just sweep the frequency of a measure-pulse using the `resonator_spectroscopy` experiment workflow, or perform a 2D sweep to optimize at the same time the amplitude of the measure-pulse (the `resonator_spectroscopy_amplitude` experiment workflow). The measure-pulse modulated at different frequencies will be sent on a readout line traversing multiple resonators each coupled with one qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When isolated, a superconducting resonator can be fully described simply by the magnetic flux threaded through the inductor $\\phi$ and the difference $n$ in the number of charges on the two plates of the capacitor in units of Copper pairs. In this case, the resulting Hamiltonian will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\frac{E_L}{2}\\phi^2 + 4 E_C n^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above Hamiltonian is changed when the resonator is in contact with an external environment, consisting of coupling to other quantum elements and other undesired interactions with a dissipative bath. This more general Hamiltonian can be simplified in the limit where the resonator and the quantum element are far detuned and there is weak anharmonicity. In this regime, the net effect of this interaction will be a shift in the frequency of both quantum elements due to the Lamb shift. For small couplings, the change in frequency for the resonator will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\omega^{1}_R \\approx \\omega_R + \\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the coupling between the two elements and $\\Delta$ is their difference in frequency. This frequency shift effectively allows us to measure the state of a quantum element by checking the response of its coupled resonator. This method is called *dispersive readout*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/resonators_and_qubits.svg \"Sketch of the layout of a simple chip with each qubits coupled to a resonator.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this context, we see now that the scope of this experiment workflow is to characterize the resonator at a particular qubit state, typically when this is in its ground state, by looking at the response in the readout line to different frequencies. In practice, the exact response depends on the details of the circuit. Here is an example of how data would look like when several resonators are connected to the same line:\n",
