    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll optimize the pulse amplitude of the pi-pulse for a given qubit transition using error amplfication: the `amplitude_fine` experiment included in the LabOne Q Applications Library. It is recommended to have the pulse amplitude already roughly calibrated, e.g. with the `amplitude_rabi` experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude of a pulse can be precisely calibrated using error amplifying gate sequences. These gate sequences apply the same quantum operation (qop) a variable number of times. Therefore, if each qop has a small error $\\theta$ in the rotation angle then a sequence of multiple qop's will have a rotation error of $\\text{reps}\\cdot \\theta$, where $\\text{reps}$ is the number of repetitions. By implementing sequences with increasing number of repetitions we can obtain a correction value for the imperfect pulse amplitude (see also https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-experiments/tutorials/calibrations). A larger number of repetitions leads to a higher precision in the pulse calibration, finally limited by the coherence time of the qubit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/amplitude_fine.svg \"Demonstration of pulses and the corresponding rotation around the Bloch sphere during an amplitude fine experiment.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `amplitude_fine` experiment, we add an x90 gate before the gates that are repeated, in order to move the ideal population to the equator of the Bloch sphere where the sensitivity to over/under rotations is the highest. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/amplitude_fine_underrotation.svg \"Plots showing the results of pulses with too-small amplitudes, which cause under-rotation, and those with correct amplitudes.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show the results of an amplitude-fine experiment for calibration an x180 operation. The ping-pong pattern in the figure on the left indicates an under-rotation which makes the initial state rotate less than $\\pi$. The rotated phase per gate $\\phi_{\\text{x180}}$ is given by the frequency of the fitted oscillation. The comparison to the ideal angle defines the correction factor $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "$c=\\frac{\\phi_{\\text{x180}}}{\\pi}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we scale our amplitude by $c^{-1}$ to obtain the optimized amplitude. \n",
