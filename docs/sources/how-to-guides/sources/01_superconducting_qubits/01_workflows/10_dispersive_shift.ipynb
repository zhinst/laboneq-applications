    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll be measuring the dispersive shift of the readout resonator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements on superconducting qubits such as Transmons are often based on dispersive readout. Here, the qubit itself is not directly probed, instead a resonator, which is coupled capacitively to the qubit, is probed with a measure pulse close to its resonance frequency (see figure below). The amplitude and phase of the returning measure pulse (here transmitted) contain information about the qubit state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersive limit is a regime where the qubit frequency ($\\omega_Q$) is far detuned from the resonance frequency of the resonator ($\\omega_R$) such that its detuning ($\\Delta = |\\omega_Q-\\omega_R|$) is large compared to the coupling strength ($g \\ll \\Delta$). In this regime, the cavity frequency experiences a dispersive shift,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pm\\chi = \\pm\\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "dependent on the qubit state. This is illustrated in the figure below that shows the transmitted amplitude and phase responses of the readout resonator when qubit is in its ground and excited states. Higher excited stats of the qubits can be similarly measured through dispersive readout.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Transmitted amplitude and phase response of the readout resonator coupled to a qubit in state g, e and f. When the resonator is probed, the transmitted amplitude and phase contain information about the qubit state.](../../../images/dispersive_ro_1_gef.svg \"Transmitted amplitude and phase response of the readout resonator coupled to a qubit in state g, e and f. When the resonator is probed, the transmitted amplitude and phase contain information about the qubit state.\")\n",
