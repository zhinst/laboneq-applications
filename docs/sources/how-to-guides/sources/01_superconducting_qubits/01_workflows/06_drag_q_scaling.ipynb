    "### Background\n",
    "In this experiment, we determine the quadrature scaling factor, $\\beta$, of a Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulse, which is optimal for cancelling dynamics phase errors that occur during the application of a qubit drive pulse. The DRAG drive pulse has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v(t)=i(t) + q(t),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the quadrature component $q(t)$ is given by the derivative of the in-phase component $i(t)$, scaled by a factor $\\beta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q(t) = \\beta \\frac{d(i(t))}{d(t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the optimal $\\beta$ for compensating phase errors, we apply a pulse sequence that is sensitive to phase errors and sweep the value of $\\beta$ for all the drive pulses in the sequence. As shown in the image below, we use pairs of drive pulses followed by a measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/drag_sequence.svg \"Quantum circuit diagram from the DRAG pulse calibration. RO refers to the measurement.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of phase errors, all three of these sequences of two pulses should move the state vector of a qubit prepared in the ground state onto the equator, along the $\\pm \\hat{y}$ axis of the Bloch sphere. However, phase errors introduce unwanted rotations around the $\\hat{z}$ axis during the application of the pulse, resulting in the qubit state vector ending up away from the equatorial plane for the pulse pairs `x90-y180` and `x90-ym180` as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/drag_bloch.svg \"Cartoon of the qubit state vectors on the Bloch sphere after the first x90 (black) gate and after the subsequent second gate (colors) in the presence of phase errors.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the calibration experiment is to find the quadrature scaling factor $\\beta$ that results in all three pairs of pulses correctly moving the qubit state vector onto the equator as shown in the following plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../../images/drag_plot.svg \"Excited-state population after applying the pulse sequences as a function of the scaling factor with a second-order DRAG. The colored markers and lines are correspond to the respective pulse sequences. The vertical line indicates the optimal value for cancelling phase errors.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we refer to the $\\beta$ parameter as a \"q-scaling\". If multiple qubits are passed to the experiment, the above pulses are applied in parallel on all the qubits."
