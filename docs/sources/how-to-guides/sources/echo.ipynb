Please see these guides (add links) if you need to create your setup and qubits for the first time. However, you can also run this notebook \"as is\" using an emulated session. If you are just getting started with the LabOne Q Applications Library, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at info@zhinst.com."

    "### Background\n",
    "In this how-to guide, you'll perform a Hahn echo experiment to measure the transversal relaxation of a qubit using the `echo` experiment included in the LabOne Q Applications Library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous how-to-guide, we already used Ramsey interferometry (link to ramsey how-to) to measure the transversal relaxation ( $T_2^*$ ). However, the Ramsey experiment is sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations. The Hahn echo protocol is less sensitive to quasi-static noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ramsey protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a short summary of the Ramsey protocol: \n",
    "\n",
    "A $X_{\\pi/2}$ (X90) pulse positions the Bloch vector on the equator (Fig. 1a). Typically, the carrier frequency of this pulse is slightly detuned from the qubit frequency. As a result, the Bloch vector will rotate around the z-axis. After waiting for a time $\\tau$, a second $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the z-axis. Repeated measurements are made to take an ensemble averaged estimate of the qubit polarization, as a function of $\\tau$. The resulting oscillations feature an approximately exponential decay function with decaytime $T_2^*$. (from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06560)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the “ $^*$ ” indicates that the Ramsey experiment is sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening. That is, it is highly sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations that are constant within one experimental trial, but vary from trial to trial, e.g., due to $1/f$-type noise. These fluctuations cause a dephasing of the qubit state (Fig. 1b) during the time $\\tau$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hahn echo protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's have a look at the Hahn echo protocol, which is less sensitive to quasi-static noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform the same protocol as for the Ramsey interferometry, but place one extra $Y_\\pi$ (Y180) pulse in-between the two $X_{\\pi/2}$ pulses (X90). The accumulated dephasing during the first period can be undone (refocused) in the second period by rotating the qubit state by 180 $^\\circ$ in-between through an $Y_{\\pi}$ pulse. The final $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the z-axis. In summary the overall quasi-static contributions to dephasing are reduced, leaving an estimate $T_{2e}$ that is less sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pulses are generally chosen to be resonant with the qubit transition for a Hahn echo, since any frequency detuning would be nominally refocused anyway.\n",
