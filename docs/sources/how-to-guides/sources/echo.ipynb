However, the Ramsey experiment is sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations. The Hahn echo protocol is less sensitive to quasi-static noise. \n",

As a result, the Bloch vector will rotate around the z-axis. After waiting for a time $\\tau$, a second $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the z-axis. Repeated measurements are made to take an ensemble averaged estimate of the qubit polarization, as a function of $\\tau$. The resulting oscillations feature an approximately exponential decay function with decaytime $T_2^*$. (from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06560)\n",

That is, it is highly sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations that are constant within one experimental trial, but vary from trial to trial, e.g., due to $1/f$-type noise. These fluctuations cause a dephasing of the qubit state (Fig. 1b) during the time $\\tau$. \n",

The accumulated dephasing during the first period can be undone (refocused) in the second period by rotating the qubit state by 180 $^\\circ$ in-between through an $Y_{\\pi}$ pulse. The final $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the z-axis. In summary the overall quasi-static contributions to dephasing are reduced, leaving an estimate $T_{2e}$ that is less sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms.\n",
